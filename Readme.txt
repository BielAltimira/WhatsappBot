Hi!
At this point I was a bit lost with my path as a programer. I didn't exacly know how to continue or even if this was really what I liked.
I decided to create this project as something easy, fun to code and useful to regain interest in programing. By using the modules requests
and beautiful soup we web scrape some data from a weather webpage and then we send it to a whatsapp number through a bot called Twillio.
